        <h1># About</h1>
        <p>Tom Kay (b. 1995) is a self-taught game developer, writer, and composer based in New Jersey. He is fascinated by old game hardware and how we can make new games, music, and software for them in our present era, thereby keeping them alive. In his games, he is devoted to exploring the interplay between minimalist visual and gameplay design and immersive storytelling and audio design. He firmly believes that the key to making a game is a simple idea and the determination to make it real.</p>
